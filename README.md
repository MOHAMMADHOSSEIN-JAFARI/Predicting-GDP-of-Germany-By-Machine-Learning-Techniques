# Working-Project-Predicting-GDP-of-Germany-By-Machine-Learning-Techniques.
We get the real GDP of EU countries, in addition to United States of America, and Canada from 1970 to 2019.  Then we get the lag of their GDP, and calculating the Hodrickâ€“Prescott filter
to remove the influnces of the business cycles. In the next step, we will calculate the output gap for each country. 
Then we will run rolling window to get timevarying correlations of the output gaps between Germany and each country. 
Then we will run Machine Learning techniques to check which country can can better forecast the GDP of Germany.
